+ BUG: PushState must drop the new state if the constructor fails
+ Revamp error handling (print  SDL errors, export error strings to make anyone able to display them)
+ Make Error code consistent
+ Use an enum for the error codes
+ if a log file contains more than 8191 entries, the program triggers an access violation
+ RawData/FilteredData really useful?
+ use SDL/TTF_GetError()
- Use a "color profil" for the UI
- use different cursors for zoom/pan
- add a CASCADE_VERTICAL_ALIGNED option, to adjust the size of the vertical buttons
- correctly handle states: wait for the run() method to be terminated before launching another state
